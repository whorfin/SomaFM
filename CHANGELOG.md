# Version History

## November, 2024
- Release as v3.0.4
- Switch to polling for track details; avoids issues with missed metadata observertions [recent mpv flatpak bug], simplifies code, handles HLS, and avoids duplicate playback stream in chromecast and HLS scenarios to save SomaFM un-needed stream play fees
- Update pychromecast and test once more
- Release as v2.7.18
- Fix spinner
- Various robustness improvements

## October, 2024
- Release as v2.7.15
- Humanize runtime better
- API query retry with exponential backoff

## September, 2024
- Release as v2.7.12
- Show progress of socket connection and bitrate computation
- Detect `mpv` launch failure during socket connection; `mpv` in older distros such as focal lacked IPC control
- Full agent declaration

## August, 2024
- Release as v2.7.4
- Rewrite to use IPC rather than scraping stdout UX from `mpv`
- Query tracks from API - provides album info, and works with HLS
- Support LOVE and WTF?!
- Drop stationID highlighting - station IDS are not identified by the API
    - ... and it has become very inconsistent from station to station and not all IDs are long enough for the metadata to update
- Grab audio information from player processing, not just icy-data - this supports HLS
- Added support for lossless HLS playback with track information
- Unescape metadata which remains with weird embedded escapes, especially unicode zero-width-space
- Switch to "auto" audio device default; works for everybody
    - and since `pipewire` replaces `alsa/pipewire` on more recent `mpv` versions
- Buffer usage tweaking for minimum memory
- Last old-style Release as v1.88-whorfin

## July, 2024
- Release as v1.86-whorfin
- Remove support for all but `mpv`
- support robust reconnects via playlist looping
- set stream buffer to 4 seconds for fast start and quick recoveery
- target pipewire for audio, but allow bypassing the force-option
- fix channel parsing to find and use highest bitrate AAC codec
- channel information downloaded whenever it is needed, not written to disk
- no more Highlander Rules (there can be more than one)
- killall considered harmful
- change the default channel to be correct - Drone Zone
- sort the channel list
- mpv can provide all the information we require - use it
- use raw strings for SomaFM 1337 logos to avoid recent python bitching
- improve fuzzy channel matching robustness
- indicate current streaming server, and update when it changes
- handle audio output more flexibly, a gift for non-pipewire peeps
- detect when there is an audio output driver error, notify user, and break out of playlist loop
- make chromecast work - discovery and shutdown are proper, and AAC playback is supported
- simplify main loop, reduce CPU load even more
